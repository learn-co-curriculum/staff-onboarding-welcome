# Welcome to Flatiron School!

Welcome Aboard,

 Welcome to Flatiron School (and to Learn). We are so glad you are here and a part of our team- changing the face of education. 
 
 If you haven't used Learn before, here's how it works:
- The left-hand column is your navigator. There are three levels of hiearchy:
  - "General Onboarding" is a **topic**. One day, we will deploy additional topics to new hires based on the team they're on (e.g. "Marketing Onboarding" or "Instructor Onboarding").
  - "Welcome", "Tasks", and "Reading" are **units**. Units contain **lessons**; a lesson is what you're currently reading.
- When you finish a lesson, click the "I'm Done" button in the right-hand column, and then click "Next Lesson".

If you have any questions, please reach out to Sarah who is in charge of the onboarding process.

Happy Learning!
