# Welcome to Flatiron School!

Hello,

We are so happy you are here! Welcome to Flatiron School (and to Learn). We just started using Learn for employee onboarding (so please excuse any bugs; better yet, suggest a change or make a direct edit!) If you haven't used Learn before, here's how it works:
- The left-hand column is your navigator. There are three levels of hiearchy:
  - "General Onboarding" is a **topic**. One day, we might be able to deploy additional topics to new hires based on the team they're on (e.g. "Marketing Onboarding" or "Instructor Onboarding").
  - "Welcome", "Tasks", and "Reading" are **units**. Units contain **lessons**; a lesson is what you're currently reading.
- When you finish a lesson, click the "I'm Done" button in the right-hand column, and then click "Next Lesson".

**Note:** Before you begin, please check your inbox for an email from Atlassian, and follow the instructions to get set up for an account. You will need it for many of the links that follow.

If you have any questions, ask Mike Linshi!

One last thing - in case it takes you a while to get to the section on the various codes around 11 Broadway, the bathroom codes are 11215 (men's room) and 11260 (women's room).

Happy Learning!
