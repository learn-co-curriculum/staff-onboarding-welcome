# Welcome to Flatiron School!

Hello,

We are so happy you are here! Welcome to Flatiron School (and to Learn). We just started using Learn for employee onboarding (so please excuse any bugs; better yet, suggest a change or make a direct edit!) If you haven't used Learn before, here's how it works:
- The left-hand column is your navigator. There are three levels of hiearchy:
  - "General Onboarding" is a **topic**. One day, we might be able to deploy additional topics to new hires based on the team they're on (e.g. "Marketing Onboarding" or "Instructor Onboarding").
  - "Welcome", "Tasks", and "Reading" are **units**. **Units** contain **lessons**; a lesson is what you're currently reading.
- When you finish a lesson, click the "I'm Done" button in the right-hand column, and then click "Next Lesson".

If you have ay questions, ask Mike Linshi!
